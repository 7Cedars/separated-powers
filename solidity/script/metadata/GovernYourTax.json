    "An example of a community organised around usage of a token, instead of ownership. It governs a mock token (Erc20TaxedMock, MTXD) that collects tax on every transaction; tax payers can decide on how this tax is used. They elect governors that can propose new grants to grant councils, allocating a budget to the councils. Members can propose and vote on grant proposals. Councils make the final decisions on what grants to fund within their allocated budget. The security council can stop and restart any law at any time.",
