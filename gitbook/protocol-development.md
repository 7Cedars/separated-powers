# Protocol development

## Aims

There are several aims and ethos that guide the development of the Powers protocol.&#x20;

* **Open source.** The core protocol and example laws are and will always remain open source.
* **SImplicity.** In developing the protocol simplicity is prioritised over gas efficiency. ...&#x20;
* **Composability.** The protocol should integrate seamlessly with other implementations of the  protocol, and with existing governance solutions such as OpenZeppelin's Governor.sol, Compounds GovernorBravo and the Hats protocol.
* **Security.** The protocol should not be allowed to govern actual assets before being properly audited and being subject to a well funded bounty program. This also applies to future upgrades and (current and future) law implementations.&#x20;

## Milestones

### v0.3 (future)

* Implement integration modules for existing protocols. &#x20;
* Implement integration for off-chain services.&#x20;
* Revise naming of function and variables in Powers.sol.
* Further develop and simplify laws.&#x20;
* Improve error handling. &#x20;

### v0.2 (current)&#x20;

* Simplified Powers.sol
* Implemented modular laws.
* Implemented dynamic UI / UX to interact with a wide range of governance structures.   &#x20;
* Renamed the protocol to Powers protocol.&#x20;

### v0.1

* First PoC of Role restricted governance protocol. Initially named Separated Powers.  &#x20;
* Build for the RnDao's CollabTech hackathon in Oct-Nov 2024.&#x20;
