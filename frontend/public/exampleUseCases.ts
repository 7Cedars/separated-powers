    title: "Managing a plurality of legal regimes",
    challenge: "Crypto communities are global. They interact with a plurality of legal regimes (the US, EU, China) when governing their community.",
    solution: "Using robust KYC mechanisms, roles can be assigned to users in specific local jurisdictions. This allows for selective in- and exclusion of users from executive actions. It creates a unified governance system that adapts to local jurisdictions.",
  },
  {
    title: "Building guard rails for AI agents",
    challenge: "Increasingly, AI agents are taking over tasks in organisation and communities. As they start managing (real-world) assets, the need for human oversight becomes more apparent.",
    solution: "Assigning roles to human and AI agents, role restricted governance protocols allow for flexible and bespoke guard rails for AI agents, allowing for seamless interaction with other (human and AI) agents in a community.",
  },
  {
    title: "Protecting against hostile takeovers",
    challenge: "Hostile governance takeovers remain a threat to on-chain governance. Solutions to address this risk have led to increased complexity in governance protocols.",
    solution: "Role restricted governance protocols have two inherent properties that decrease the chance of hostile takeovers: they allow for roles to check each others actions and disallow a direct translation of token holdings to voting power.",
  }, 
  {
    title: "Building hybrid on- and off-chain systems",
    challenge: "Following the start of crypto ETFs, a need for hybrid governance systems has emerged: giving customers voting power, but within clearly defined boundaries.",
    solution: "Role restricted governance protocols provide full control over who has what power. It allows for hybrid governance systems where a corporate off-chain entity defines the range fo powers that customers have on-chain.",
  },
  {
    title: "Facilitate decentralisation", 
    challenge: "A problem in on-chain community governance is the tendency for token holdings and delegate votes to centralise around a small set of accounts.", 
    solution: "The Powers protocol allows for the creation of roles for builders, community leaders, token holders and any other stake holder. Decentralising power by giving different groups actual influence in community governance.",
  }, 
  {
    title: "Manage dynamic complexity in governance",
    challenge: "Current governance protocols give little flexibility to adapt voting procedures to changing circumstances.",
    solution: "In the Powers Protocol, laws define roles and define their powers. They can be adopted and revoked through internal governance mechanisms to adapt to changing circumstances, and hence provide flexibility without giving in on security.",
