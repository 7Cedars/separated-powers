    title: "Manage complex and dynamic governance",
    challenge: "Organisations change over time. Legacy governance protocols are difficult to adapt to these changing circumstances.",
    solution: "In the Powers protocol, laws define roles and their powers. They can be adopted and revoked through internal governance mechanisms. It allows for modular governance that is flexible within clearly defined guardrails.",
  }, 
  {
    title: "Building guard rails for AI agents",
    challenge: "Increasingly, AI agents are taking over tasks in organisation and communities. As they do so, the need for guard rails is clear.",
    solution: "Assigning roles to human and AI agents, role restricted governance protocols allow for flexible and bespoke guard rails for AI agents, allowing for seamless interactions between (human and AI) agents in a community.",
  },
  {
    title: "Protecting against hostile takeovers",
    challenge: "Hostile governance takeovers remains a threat to on-chain communities. Existing solutions tend to add complexity to already complex protocols.",
    solution: "Role restricted governance protocols have two inherent properties that decrease the chance of hostile takeovers: they allow for roles to check each others actions and disallow a direct translation of token holdings to voting power.",
  }, 
  {
    title: "Building hybrid on- and off-chain systems",
    challenge: "With crypto ETFs, a need for hybrid governance systems emerged: giving customers voting power but within clearly defined boundaries.",
    solution: "Role restricted governance protocols provide full control over who has what power. It allows for hybrid governance systems where a corporate off-chain entity defines the range fo powers that customers have on-chain.",
  },
  {
    title: "Facilitate decentralisation", 
    challenge: "A challenge in on-chain communities is the tendency for decision-making power to centralise around a small set of accounts.", 
    solution: "The Powers protocol allows for giving distinct powers to builders, community leaders, token holders and any other stakeholder. Decentralising power by giving stakeholders different powers in community governance.",
  }, 
  {
    title: "Managing a plurality of legal regimes",
    challenge: "Crypto communities are global. They interact with a plurality of legal regimes (the US, EU, China) when governing their community.",
    solution: "Using robust KYC mechanisms, roles can be assigned to users in specific local jurisdictions. It allows for selective in- and exclusion of users from executive actions.",
